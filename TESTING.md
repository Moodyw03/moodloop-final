### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, mozilla and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone x,IPad, iPhone pro.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that the app was responsive in all devices.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

- There's a noticeable millisecond delay at the conclusion of each loop, attributable to the buffer of the Web Audio API. It appears this buffer isn't sufficiently robust to manage 4 players seamlessly.

- Occasionally, upon selecting the "pre-listen" option, certain audio files exhibit a reduced volume.
