Welcome to Moodloop, a web-based stem mixing interface that allows you to create quick tracks by combining different stems and sounds. With Moodloop, you can easily drag or click on arrows to mix up to four different stems, including rhythm, bass, percussion, and synth. Whether you're a music enthusiast, producer, or simply looking to explore your creativity, Moodloop is here to help you bring your ideas to life.

This submission represents Milestone Project 2 for the Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development program. My website comprises one audio app and utilizes the HTML, CSS and Javascript technologies I have acquired throughout the course.

</div>

- #### Colour Scheme
  Primary Color - Azure Radiance:
  Hex: #20242c
  Usage: Ideal for primary buttons, headers, and active navigation items. Azure Radiance exudes a sense of sophistication and depth.
  2. Secondary Color - Moody Blue:
  Hex: #6263d7
  Usage: Perfect for secondary UI elements, hover states, and subtle highlights. Moody Blue adds vibrancy and a touch of creativity.
 3. Gradient Start - Light Sky Blue:
  Hex: #87CEFA
  Usage: This lighter shade of blue can serve as the starting point for background gradients or soft UI highlights, initiating the sense of movement.
  4. Gradient Mid - Cornflower Blue:
  Hex: #6495ED
  Usage: Serves as the mid-point in our gradient, transitioning smoothly from Light Sky Blue to Azure Radiance, reinforcing the feeling of flow and transition.
  5. Text Color - Shuttle Gray:
  Hex: #5e6267
  Usage: Used primarily for text, ensuring readability against the gradient blue background.

- #### Typography

Font Family: Roboto Mono

Description: Roboto Mono is a monospaced variant of the Roboto typeface. With its evenly spaced characters and clear, modern design, Roboto Mono provides an aesthetic of precision and technicality. This makes it an ideal choice for Moodloop, where a blend of creativity and structure is essential. The typeface ensures that text across the platform is easily readable while still retaining a contemporary and sleek appearance. Whether used in headers or body text, Roboto Mono brings consistency and a touch of modernity to the user interface.

- #### Imagery

 <strong>Animated CSS Background.</strong>
Leveraging the capabilities of CSS animations, the interface boasts a dynamic background that evolves over time. This not only infuses the platform with an element of motion but also ensures that the users' attention remains engaged. Such animated backgrounds bring visual interest and a touch of liveliness, elevating the user experience of any website or web application.
Beyond static colors, the interface employs a shifting background gradient animated through CSS. The gradual transition of colors provides depth and a sense of fluidity. The ever-changing hues instill a mood of continuous exploration and wonder, aligning perfectly with the dynamic nature of the Moodloop platform. This approach goes beyond mere aesthetics, as it subtly guides users through the platform, ensuring their experience remains fresh and immersive.

## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes

-   Interactive elements
    Ensuring Adaptability Across Devices:

In today's digital landscape, users access web platforms through a plethora of devices, each with varying screen sizes and resolutions. Ensuring a consistent and optimized experience across all these devices is paramount. This is where media queries come into play.
How Does Moodloop Use Media Queries?
Breakpoints: We've defined specific breakpoints for common device sizes (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, and large desktop screens). When the viewport size meets the criteria of a breakpoint, a particular set of CSS rules is applied, ensuring the content looks and functions optimally for that device.

Fluid Grids: By using relative units like percentages rather than fixed units like pixels, the layout elements of Moodloop resize in proportion to the screen size. Media queries then fine-tune this fluidity, adjusting the design for specific devices or orientations.

Flexible Images: Images on the Moodloop platform are set to resize within the containing elements. Combined with media queries, this ensures images look crisp and clear without distorting or breaking the layout.

Adaptive UI Elements: Buttons, navigation menus, and other UI elements adjust based on the device size. For example, the drop-zone disappears on smaller devices to give place to an arrow-click button on the audio files.
Enhanced User Experience: By adjusting typography size, margins, and padding based on the device, Moodloop ensures that the text remains readable, and spacing is consistent, providing a comfortable viewing experience regardless of the device.

The Outcome:
By leveraging media queries, Moodloop offers a seamless user experience across the vast array of devices available on the market. Whether a user accesses the platform from a compact smartphone, a sprawling desktop monitor, or anything in between, they are met with a design that is intuitive, visually appealing, and tailored to their device's unique characteristics.

This section paints a clear picture of how media queries are employed within the Moodloop platform to ensure a responsive and consistent user experience.
